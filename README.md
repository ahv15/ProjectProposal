# Project Proposal

## Introduction
NLP involves the development of algorithms and models to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It encompasses a wide range of tasks like text classification, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis etc. NLP techniques are applied for virtual assistants, information retrieval etc. We will use NLP to perform multiclass text classification to tag complaints to product/service.
### Literature Review
- This paper is the basis of Word2Vec text vectorization techniques that we will employ to perform word embedding. Word2Vec is a neural network framework that places similar words in a closer geometric space.
- Explores classification of consumer reviews using multiple supervised models like k-NN, MNB, RF, XGBoost and SVM. Similar to our topic and will provide guidance on our approach.
- Describes active learning approach for text categorization, aiming to reduce manual labeling effort by selecting informative samples through multi-class SVM classifiers, enhancing classification accuracy without compromising efficiency.
- To analyze environmental education research journals, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used to classify research topics. Results show that K-means and LDA methods largely align in identifying categories.

### [Dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database)
Collection of complaints about financial products and services. Dataset has 18 columns and millions of records. There are 21 product and service labels. For our analysis we will be using a reduced dataset of around 200k records. We plan to use around 10k rows from each category to avoid class imbalance.

## Problem Definition

Customer issue resolution is one of the most important facets in running a smooth business operation and providing satisfactory services.  One of the biggest bottlenecks is identification and tagging of complaints to respective products/services. We can employ NLP techniques to parse complaint text and classify which product the complaint corresponds to which automates the tagging process, thus reducing the need for human intervention and automating the process to decrease complaint resolution time.
